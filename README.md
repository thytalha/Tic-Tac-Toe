## How to Compile and Run

Use any C++ compiler like g++ to compile the code:

g++ -o tic_tac_toe main.cpp  
./tic_tac_toe

(Replace main.cpp with your actual file name if it's different.)

## How to Play

- The program starts by asking for names of two players.
- Talha plays as X and Pasha plays as O.
- Each player takes turns entering a row and column number (1 to 3).
- The symbol (X or O) is placed on the selected position if it's empty.
- The game checks after each turn for a win or a draw.
- If a player gets 3 of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win.
- If all spaces are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.
