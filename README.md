## 🚀 Overview

Forget complex graphics engines. We are going back to the roots of logic.

This is **Tic-Tac-Toe** powered by a raw C++ engine. It features a custom 5x5 grid rendering system, robust input validation to prevent crashes, and a classic hotseat multiplayer mode. Whether you call it *Noughts and Crosses* or *Xs and Os*, the goal remains the same: **Dominate the Grid.**

## ✨ Features

* ⚔️ **Local PvP:** Challenge a friend on the same machine (Hotseat mode).
* 🛡️ **Ironclad Input Validation:** Accidentally typed an invalid number? No problem. The game handles errors gracefully without crashing.
* 🧠 **Smart Logic:** Automatic detection for Wins (Rows, Columns, Diagonals) and Draws.
* 🎨 **Custom Board Renderer:** A clean, ASCII-based interface that redraws the board after every move.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Name Your Gladiators:** Enter names for **Player 1** (who plays as ❌) and **Player 2** (who plays as ⭕).
2.  **Pick Your Spot:** The grid is mapped using coordinates.
3.  **Strike:** Enter the **Row** number (1-3) and then the **Column** number (1-3).
4.  **Victory:** Align 3 symbols to win. If the board fills up, it's a draw!
